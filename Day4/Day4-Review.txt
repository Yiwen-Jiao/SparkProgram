NoSQL clusters are used to:
  1. write queries without the need for NoSQL
* 2. scale transaction performance and volume
  3. perform rapid data warehousing queries
  4. guarantee ACID properties

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that saves data as
  1. records
  2. key/value pairs
* 3. documents 
  4. graph

Cassandra supports all of the following SQL queries except:
  1. INSERT
  2. SELECT
 *3. JOIN
  4. DELETE

The main trade-off in choosing NoSQL vs SQL is:
  1. speed vs reliability
  2. cost vs accuracy
  3. indexes vs normalization
* 4. consistency vs availability

The Cassandra equivalent to a database is called:
* 1. keyspace
  2. namespace
  3. document
  4. there is no equivalent

The MongoDB equivalent to a table is called:
  1. document
* 2. collection
  3. namespace
  4. cursor

Spark can read MongoDB data using which method of the following type of statements:
  1. df = spark.read.nosql(***).load()
  2. df = spark.read.mongo(***).load()
* 3. df = spark.read.format(***).load()
  4. df = mongo.query(***)
