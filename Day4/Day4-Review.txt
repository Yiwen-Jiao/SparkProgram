NoSQL clusters are used to:
  1. Write queries without the need for NoSQL
* 2. Scale transaction performance and volume
  3. Perform rapid data warehousing queries
  4. Guarantee ACID properties

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that saves data as:
  1. Records
  2. Key/value pairs
* 3. Documents 
  4. Graph

Cassandra supports all of the following SQL queries except:
  1. INSERT
  2. SELECT
 *3. JOIN
  4. DELETE

The main trade-off in choosing NoSQL vs. SQL is:
  1. Speed vs. reliability
  2. Cost vs. accuracy
  3. Indexes vs. normalization
* 4. Consistency vs. availability

The Cassandra equivalent to a database is called:
* 1. Keyspace
  2. Namespace
  3. Document
  4. There is no equivalent

The MongoDB equivalent to a table is called:
  1. Document
* 2. Collection
  3. Namespace
  4. Cursor

Spark can read MongoDB data using which method of the following type of statements?
  1. df = spark.read.nosql(***).load()
  2. df = spark.read.mongo(***).load()
* 3. df = spark.read.format(***).load()
  4. df = mongo.query(***)
