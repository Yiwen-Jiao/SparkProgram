Executor

What is the main difference between a method name sortBy vs. sortByKey or reduce vs. reduceByKey?
* ByKey means the data needs to be shaped as a tuple with a key & value. Without the ByKey you need to specify how it does the key grouping.

When doing multiple transformations, it is better to chain them in one big statement vs. staging them to individual RDD variables.
* False
True

If you need a function that is more than one line long, you cannot pass it into a function because lambdas can only be one line.
* False, you can always write a function and pass the function name. Lambdas are just a convenience if they work for your situation.

* pyspark
Pandas
Spark-Shell
SparkSQL
